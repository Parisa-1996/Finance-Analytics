📊 Retail Finance Analytics & Reporting Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Finance Analytics & Reporting solution for a retail company, with an emphasis on store-level profitability analysis.

The objective is to improve financial visibility, monitor operational performance, and support strategic decision-making through structured reporting and scenario analysis.

The solution is built using a Delta Lake layered architecture and modern analytics tools, including Python, DuckDB, SQL, and Power BI.

🎯 Business Context

The retail company is facing profitability challenges despite stable sales growth.

Key Business Problems

Operating margin has remained flat for several quarters.

Costs are rising faster than sales, especially in:

Logistics

Marketing

Limited real-time visibility into financial performance.

Finance data is spread across ERP systems.

Reporting processes are manual and inconsistent.

Limited insight into profitability drivers at store level.

Business Goal

Increase overall profitability by approximately 10%, primarily through improving performance in key departments and enabling faster, data-driven decision making.

🏗️ Data & Architecture (High-Level)

The solution follows a Delta Lake layered data architecture:

Raw → Bronze → Silver → Gold

🔹 Raw Layer

Direct ingestion from ERP system

No transformations applied

Serves as the single source of truth

🔹 Bronze Layer

Initial data cleaning

Standardized formats

Basic validation

🔹 Silver Layer

Business transformations applied

Data modeling logic introduced

Harmonized financial structures

🔹 Gold Layer

Analytics-ready datasets

Structured for reporting

Optimized for Power BI dashboards

💡 Why Layered Architecture?

The layered approach ensures:

✅ Clarity (clear separation of stages)

✅ Traceability (full data lineage)

✅ Scalability (easy to extend)

✅ Reusability (clean data foundation for future use)

🧠 Data Modeling Approach

The Gold layer is designed to support:

Store-level profitability analysis

Department-level performance

Financial reporting (P&L structure)

Trend and variance analysis

The model supports structured reporting and dashboard performance optimization.
